    "basalt": "Basalt is a dark rock created from lava that cools very quickly, resulting in a tough and uniform texture. Its strength makes it ideal for solid structures and reliable building materials in your game.",
    "conglomerate": "Conglomerate is a sedimentary rock made of various rounded rock pieces that stick together. Its naturally worn look gives a sense of history, adding a unique touch to game environments.",
    "gneiss": "Gneiss is a metamorphic rock known for its striking, banded patterns formed under heat and pressure over time. Its cool stripes make it a great design element for creative game scenes.",
    "granite": "Granite is a durable rock that forms deep underground as magma cools slowly, resulting in large, visible crystals. Its robust and classic appearance makes it popular for construction and decorative features.",
    "limestone": "Limestone is a sedimentary rock made from the remains of sea creatures. With its smooth surface and occasional fossils, it offers a natural, earthy vibe perfect for realistic scenery.",
    "quartzite": "Quartzite is a very hard metamorphic rock formed from quartz-rich sandstone. Its sparkling, resilient surface makes it ideal for areas needing extra toughness and visual appeal.",
    "sandstone": "Sandstone is formed from compressed sand particles and comes in a range of colors and textures. Its warm, natural look is great for creating realistic landscapes in your game.",
    "shale": "Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock that splits into thin layers. Made from compacted clay and silt, it gives a delicate, layered look that adds depth to game worlds.",
    "tuff": "Tuff is a volcanic rock formed from compacted volcanic ash after an eruption. Its lightweight and porous nature, along with its unique texture, make it a fun choice for creative and dynamic scenes."
